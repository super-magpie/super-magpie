👋 Hi, I’m @super-magpie

👀 I’m interested in revolutionizing data visualization and analytics. By simplifying complex data pipelines and automating the creation of insightful, dynamic visuals, we're making data more accessible and actionable for developers and businesses alike.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about the latest trends in time-series databases, data streaming technologies, and advancements in AI for data analysis. Staying at the cutting edge helps us refine Magpie and offer the most value to our users.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of data visualization, especially those that can benefit from Magpie's capabilities. If you're working on data-driven applications and need a robust, easy-to-integrate solution for real-time analytics and visualization, let's chat!

📫 How to reach me: Drop us a line at hello@magpie.report for collaboration inquiries, support, or if you just want to talk data. We're always excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts.

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the name "Magpie" was inspired by the bird known for its intelligence and adaptability? We aim to embody these qualities in our approach to data visualization—smart, versatile, and always ready to tackle new challenges.
